Using 12 bands of Sentinel-2 satellite over ROC. - sentinel2_rochester.npy
    - the satellite provides multispectral data across - visible,
                                                       - near-infrared (NIR)
                                                       - shortware infrared (SWIR) regions.

Problem 1:
    Goal: plot_band(args)
    # plot each of the 12 bands separately - ensure that I identify what each band corresponds to in terms of its wavelength.
    # What is my approach to a proper visualization in terms of stretching? Implement it in my visualization.
    # how would i consider part of the image which has no data? --> I got the hint from the class, replace it with NaN and ignore the NaNs while theorising how to properly visualize it.
    # but best to research how such kind of visualization is usually done.

Each pixel has got 12 values: 12 bands. And the .npy file itself does not carry band names, it only stores those pixel numbers, simple.
Okay wait:
"Plotting bands":
    1 to 12 bands. Different colors.
    For Visible "True" color it should be a combo of B4 B3 B2 (RGB).
    similarly make up other combos, like how prof did during class, lets just google that.
    ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
    found it in that website, okay:
        1. Normal color B4 B3 B2
        2. Color Infrared (B8, B4, B3): healthy or unhealthy vegetation. Near infrared B8 band good at reflecting chlorophyll. Hence denser veg => red. But urban areas are white.
        3. Short-Wave Infrared (B12, B8A, B4): shortwave-infrared regions (SWIR) B12, Near infrared regions (NIR) B8, red B4.
        Okay wait.....how do i do all this though, am I supposed to get this intuitively or can i just imitate and learn whatevers in the website. 1 and 2 make good sense, rest all a bit hard to understand.
        But write them anyway:
        4. Agriculture (B11, B8, B2): SWIR-1 B11, NIR B8, blue B2. Used to monitor health of crops using SWIR and NIR. Both these bands are good at highlighting dense veg appearing as dark green.
        5. Geology (B12, B11, B2): SWIR NIR and Blue. Good for finding geological features. Faults, lithology, geological formations.
        6. Bathymetric (B4, B3, B1): great for coastal studies. Red, Green, Coastal band B1. Coastal aerosol band is good for estimating suspended sediment in water.
        7. Vegetation Index (B8-B4)/(B8+B4): NIR -> veg strongly reflects, Red -> veg strongly absorbs. Veg index good for quantifying amount of vegetation = normalized difference vegetation index.
                                            High values = dense canopy, low or negative values urban or water features.
        8. Moisture Index (B8A-B11)/(B8A+B11): ideal for finding water stress in plants. SWIR & NIR to generate an index of moisture content.
                                             High values = wetter vegetation, and low values means plants under stress due to insufficient moisture.

    Q. How to know which band is which?
        same website above. Central wavelength is what is mentioned for every Band.
            Band	Resolution	Central Wavelength	Description
            B1	60 m	443 nm	Ultra Blue (Coastal and Aerosol)
            B2	10 m	490 nm	Blue
            B3	10 m	560 nm	Green
            B4	10 m	665 nm	Red
            B5	20 m	705 nm	Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR)
            B6	20 m	740 nm	Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR)
            B7	20 m	783 nm	Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR)
            B8	10 m	842 nm	Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR)
            B8a	20 m	865 nm	Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR)
            B9	60 m	940 nm	Short Wave Infrared (SWIR)
            B10	60 m	1375 nm	Short Wave Infrared (SWIR)
            B11	20 m	1610 nm	Short Wave Infrared (SWIR)
            B12	20 m	2190 nm	Short Wave Infrared (SWIR)
Okay I am unable to understand how to identify which is which from the 12 sentinel 2 bands. I will just follow the ones above in order of bands. Skipping B10 since its missing as mentioned in the email.
Okay so Sentinel 2 has got 13 MS bands.
